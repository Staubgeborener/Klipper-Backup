Klipper backup script for manual or automated GitHub backups

This is a backup script to create manual or automated klipper backups in a github repository. You can [see an example](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/3dprint) of what it looks like in the end.

## RTFM
I would suggest reading the [wiki](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup/wiki), as this provides detailed step-by-step instructions.

## YouTube
The user [Minimal 3DP](https://github.com/minimal3dp) has created a video about the initial setup and use of klipper-backup and made it available on YouTube. This and the wiki should explain many questions in advance.
