# Backup paths
# Note: script.sh starts its search in $HOME which is /home/{username}/
# The array accepts folders or files like the following example
# 
#  backupPaths=( \
#  "printer_data/config/*" \
#  "printer_data/config/printer.cfg" \
#  )
#
# Using the above example the script will search for `/home/{username}/printer_data/config/*` and `/home/{username}/printer_data/config/printer.cfg`
# When backing up a folder you should always have `/*` at the end of the path so that files insde the folder are properly searched 

backupPaths=( \
"printer_data/config/*" \
"printer_voron2.4_data/config/*"
