<h1 style="margin-bottom:0;">Welcome to Klipper-Backup wiki</h1>
<h6 style="margin-top:0;">Klipper-Backup is a script for manual or automated GitHub backups. It's Lightweight, pragmatic and comfortable.</h6>  

This documentation provides a complete step-by-step guide to set up [klipper-backup 💾](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup). This guide is specified for the implementation on a Unix system.

## Getting started
To get started with Klipper-Backup, please jump to [Getting Started Guide](installation.md) to see detailed instructions.
However, there is also a [Quickstart](quickstart.md) if you want to get the script running as quickly as possible and are not interested about background information.

*If you are not yet updated to version 1.0.0 or greater see the following: [Migration Guide](migration.md)*

## Features
- The script does the most complex work in the background automatically
- Works perfectly with [gcode macros](manual.md/#klipper-macro)
- Can also be executed [manually in the terminal](manual.md/#shell)
- Automatic backups with [cron](automation.md/#cron)
- Switch between repositories and branches at any time

## Media
The user [Minimal 3DP](https://github.com/minimal3dp) has created a video about the initial setup and use of Klipper-Backup and made it available on YouTube. This and the docs should explain many questions in advance.
